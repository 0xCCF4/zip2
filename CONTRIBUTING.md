Pull requests are welcome, but they're subject to some requirements:

* They must build against the MSRV, the latest stable Rust version, and the nightly Rust version, both with `--no-default-features` and with `--all-features`.
* They must pass fuzz tests (see the Actions tab).
* All commits must be signed.
